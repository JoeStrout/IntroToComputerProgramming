If you go to `https://miniscript.org`, you will find links to other documentation, including the Mini Micro home page.  Look for the _Mini Micro Cheat Sheet_, a 4-page quick reference that lists all the functions you can use in Mini Micro.
You can also join the MiniScript community online, which meets via Discord and web forums.  The community is very supportive and always happy to help new coders.  Find them via the website above.
Above all, keep experimenting and trying things.  Computer programming is a deeply satisfying hobby, combining both logical and creative thinking.  It can also lead to a variety of rewarding careers.  But for now, just play around and have fun!
