## _Muffin Catch_ Game
-- left
Hereâ€™s a game using sprites (page 30) as well as randomness (page 32).  Muffins drop from the top of the screen.  Use the arrow keys (or a game pad, if you have one) to move the catcher back and forth.  Each muffin falls faster than the last.  How many can you catch?

This is the longest program in this book so far.  Take your time and type carefully (both pages).  If you get an error, compare your code to the listing printed here.  If you like, save your work with `save "muffin"`, and load it back into memory later with `load "muffin"`.
