## _Pong_ Game
-- left
Here's another fun game using sprites!  This is the classic game of _Pong_, adjusted for one player instead of two.  Use the up/down arrow keys (or, again, a game controller if you have one) to move your paddle.  Keep the ball on the screen as long as you can!

A line that begins with `//` (like line 2 in this program) is called a *comment*.  A comment is just a little note put in for human readers of the code, like you and me.  You can also put a comment at the end of a line, like on line 31.  Mini Micro ignores everything from `//` to the end of the line.
