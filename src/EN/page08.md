## First Commands
-- left
Launch Mini Micro.  (If you don’t already have Mini Micro installed, please follow the instructions on page 4.)  You should see a black screen with a beige border, displaying a welcome message.
-- right
After the welcome message is an orange square bracket, and a blinking orange box called the *cursor*.  This *prompt* is an invitation for you to type a command.  The computer is just waiting for you to tell it what to do!

-- left
The first command to try prints a message to the screen.  Type the following, exactly as shown:
[!](p08-printHello.png)
Be careful to type all in lower case, and to use quotation marks around “hello”.  Then press the Return or Enter key.
-- right
[!](p08-helloBot.png)

-- left
Mini Micro should respond by printing “hello” (without the quotation marks) on the next line.  On the line after that, the square bracket and blinking cursor has returned, ready for you to type _another_ command.
-- right
[!](p08-helloScreen.png)

-- pagebreak

Computers are fast, but not very smart.  And they can be very picky!  If you misspell a word, or use a capital letter where it should be lower-case, the computer will not understand what you mean.  Instead of doing what you wanted, it will print an *error message*.  But that's OK!  That’s just the computer’s way of letting you know it is confused.
-- right
Go ahead and try it!  Enter “Print” with a capital letter, or misspell it like “pront” and see what happens.  Don't worry, you can’t hurt anything!

-- left
The word `print` is called a *command* or *function*.  It’s a word the computer knows, if you type it correctly.
-- right
But the message you want to print can be anything, as long as you put quotation marks around it.  Try:
[!](p08-helloWorld.png)

-- puzzle
Make the computer print the message “Nice to meet you!”

Your screen may be getting a little cluttered by now.  Let’s clean it up!  Enter this command, exactly as shown, then press the Enter or Return key:
[!](p08-clearCode.png)
-- right
This command will be very useful any time your screen is full of junk, covered with pictures, or otherwise a mess.  Just enter `clear` and you’ll be back to a nice clear screen, ready to type your next command.
