## Glossary of Programming Terms
-- left
*bug*: a mistake in a computer program.
*code*: instructions in a computer program.  Sometimes also called “source code.”
*code editor*: a text editor specialized for editing computer programs (code).
*command*: a word with special meaning to a computer; using it in a program, or at a command prompt, causes the computer to do something.
*comment*: a part of a program that is ignored by the computer.  Comments are added to explain or clarify the code.
*cursor*: a blinking square or line that indicates that the computer is waiting for you to type something.  Or, in the case of “mouse cursor,” an arrow that indicates the position of the mouse on screen.
*debugging*: the process of figuring out what’s wrong with a program, and fixing it.
*degrees*: a way of measuring rotations or angles.  One full rotation is 360 degrees.
*dot syntax*: a way of referring to values or functions in a map, by using the map, followed by a period, followed by the name of the value or function.  For example, `gfx.line` refers to the `line` function on the `gfx` object.

*file*: a document stored on the disk of a computer.  Files can represent anything: images, sounds, programs, etc.
*frames (of animation)*: a series of images intended to be presented in sequence, like an animated cartoon.
*function*: a sub-program.  A function wraps up a whole section of code into something that can be run with a single command, wherever that is needed.
*game jam*: a type of contest where participants write a game in a short amount of time (often 3-7 days), based on a theme that is not announced until the contest begins.
*histogram*: a kind of bar chart where each bar represents a count of values within a certain range.
*indexing*: looking up a particular item in a list, string, or map by putting the index of the thing you want in square brackets.  For example, `msg[3]` gets element 3 of `msg`.
*infinite loop*: a loop that repeats forever, until either the user stops it by pressing Control-C, or the code breaks out of the loop with `break`.
*list*: an ordered sequence of values.  In MiniScript, these are represented with square brackets, like: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.

*loop*: a section of code that repeats multiple times.
*map*: a collection of key-value pairs.  In MiniScript, maps are enclosed in curly braces.  Maps also support _dot syntax_.
*Mini Micro*: a neo-retro virtual computer that lets you create fun games and demos in a uniform way, no matter what sort of real computer you have.
*MiniScript*: a programming language known for being especially simple, clear, and easy to learn, while still powerful enough to write real programs.
*object*: a kind of map that contains both values and functions.
*operator*: a symbol that goes into code to represent some operation on one or two values.  For example, `+` is the “plus operator” and represents addition of numbers, or joining of strings or lists.
*parameter*: a value passed into a function.  For example, in `val("42")`, `"42"` is the parameter.
*pixel*: short for picture element; a tiny square of color on a computer screen or image.
*program*: a series of instructions for a computer, written in some programming language.

*programming language*: a special language for writing instructions for a computer.  MiniScript is one example.
*prompt*: a string or character that tells the user what the computer is waiting for them to type.  In Mini Micro, the command prompt is `]`, which lets you know it is waiting for a command.
*radians*: another way of measuring rotations and angles.  One full rotation is 2\*pi radians.
*random*: something that gives a different result every time, like rolling a die, or using the `rnd` function.
*sprite*: a small image on a computer screen that can be efficiently moved, scaled, rotated, or given a color tint.
*sprite sheet*: an image designed to be carved up into multiple frames for use by a sprite (or several sprites).
*string*: an ordered set of letters, numbers, and punctuation such as `"Hello world!"`. Messages in a computer program are always represented as strings.  The term comes from a bunch of characters strung together in order, like beads on a string.

*variable*: a named storage space for a value in the computer’s memory.
