## Saving Your Work
-- left
After you have typed in a long program, you'd probably like to save it so that it is not lost as soon as you use the `reset` command, or quit Mini Micro. The `save` command does exactly that.
If you've just typed in the Cookie Baker program on the previous page, then at the Mini Micro prompt, enter:
[!](p24-saveCookieCode.png)

[!](p24-saveCookieScreen.png)
-- right
This saves the current program to a file called “cookie.ms” on your Mini Micro user disk (which is called `/usr`).
Now, use the `reset` command to clear the current program.  Or even quit and relaunch Mini Micro!  Then enter:
