## Getting Input from the User
-- left
So far, any values we stored in variables were typed right into the program itself.  But sometimes we want to ask the user for a value when the program runs.
-- right
That allows the program to do something different every time, depending on what the user types in.

You can ask the user for a value with the `input` function.  It looks like this:

[!x = input("What is x? ")](p12-inputSyntax.png)

-- left
The variable name, to the left of the `=` sign, can be the name of any variable you want to store the userâ€™s input in.  The question can be any string (message) you want to display to the user.  The word `input` must be exactly `input`. 
Try the commands shown at right.  Change the question or your answer if you like.

Make the computer ask your favorite color, and store the result in a variable called `favColor`.

The program below uses `input` twice, storing the result in two variables called `name` and `food`.  Then it prints them back out to make a suggestion.

To enter this program, first use `reset` to clear the previous program, then `edit` to open the code editor.  Type the code shown, then exit the code editor and `run` the program.

Here's a similar program that makes a silly story.  This program also shows you a new trick: you can print several strings on one line, by joining them together with a `+` sign.

_Typing these programs in is a great way to learn.  Take your time and enjoy each one!_
