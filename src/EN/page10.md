## Variables
-- left
Sometimes you need to store something like a number or a message (called a string in computer jargon) to use later.  In computer programming, you store such values in variables.  A variable is like a little storage bin for a string, number, or other value.
-- right
Each variable has a name, and can store only one thing at a time.  When you put a new value into a variable, any previous value stored there is thrown away.

Type the following two lines into Mini Micro, pressing Return or Enter after each one.  (Don’t type 001 and 002; those _line numbers_ are only printed in this book to make it easier to talk about the commands.)

Variables are how computers remember things!  Once something is stored in a variable, it stays there until it is replaced by a new value, or cleared by the `reset` command.

## Using the Code Editor
-- left
So far, you’ve been typing commands at the Mini Micro prompt.  Commands that you enter in this way are carried out immediately.   But sometimes you want to list a whole bunch of commands, like a recipe for making a cake.  In computers, such a recipe is called a *program*.
-- right
Mini Micro has a special kind of text editor (also called a *code editor*) for entering and editing programs.  To get to it, type `edit` at the prompt and press Enter or Return.

The result looks like this, but empty:

Go ahead and type in the code shown above.  Then click the green [!X](p10-closeButton.png)  button to exit the code editor, and return to the Mini Micro prompt.  Now to run your program, type `run` and press Return or Enter.

Try a longer one!  Enter `reset` at the prompt to clear the last program, then `edit` to start a new one.  Carefully type in the program at left.  Press [!X](p10-closeButton.png) to exit the code editor, then `run`.  What do you see?
