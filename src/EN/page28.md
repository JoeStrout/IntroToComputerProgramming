## Lists of Values
-- left
Up to this point, a variable has always stored a single value, either a number or a string.  But often it is useful to store a whole list of values in one variable.  To do this, you will need to find the square-bracket keys on your keyboard!
-- right
You create a list using square brackets around any number of values, separated by commas.
Type the following to create a list with three elements: "I", "love", and "pi".

Lists may also be created by splitting a string into words, as in the little program below.

To refer to any element in a list, you put the index of the one you want after the list name, in square brackets.  Because computers usually start counting at 0, these indexes start at 0 for the first item, 1 for the second, and so on.  
-- right
You can also count from the end of the list, using negative numbers: -1 is the last item, -2 is the second from the end, etc.
