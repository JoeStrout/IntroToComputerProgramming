## Installing Mini Micro

-- left 45%
To run the examples in this book, you will need to install a free program called *Mini Micro*.  Mini Micro is a virtual computer that you can program in the same way on any kind of computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

To get Mini Micro, point a web browser to this address:

[](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro)

Click on the "Download" tab at the top of the page, and then look for the buttons that say "MacOS", "Windows", and "Linux".  Click the one that matches the type of computer you have.  This should download a file called something like minimicro-win.zip.

Double-click this to open it up.  On Windows, you'll then need to click the Extract button; on Mac, it extracts automatically.  Then you should find the Mini Micro application.

The Mini Micro application icon looks like the picture at left.  Once you find that, double-click it to launch Mini Micro.  If you get a security warning, for example about needing access to files, go ahead and allow it.  Mini Micro will need to read and write files in order to save your work.

## How computers work
-- left 60%
Computers are everywhere.  There are the obvious ones, like your smart phone or game system.  There are less obvious ones, like in your microwave or your bedside clock.  And then there are the really invisible ones, like the 50 or so small computers in your car.

All these computers work in pretty much the same way.  A central processing unit (CPU) reads an instruction from memory, does what it says, and repeats, billions of times per second.

The instructions at this level are very simple, like comparing two numbers or adding them together.  By giving it the right instructions, a computer can be made to do almost anything, from playing Mozart to driving a truck.

Itâ€™s helpful to think of a computer in terms of its _inputs_, _outputs_, and _processing_.
*Inputs* are how information gets into the computer.  Often this input comes from the user, via a keyboard, mouse, or game controller.  On a touch-screen device like a phone or tablet, touch positions are also inputs.

*Outputs* are things the computer can control, like drawing images on the screen and making sounds with the speakers.
*Processing* is what the computer actually does, usually to produce outputs that depend in some way on the inputs.
