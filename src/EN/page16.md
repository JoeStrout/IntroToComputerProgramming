## Making Decisions

-- left
Many computer programs need to do different things depending on some value entered by the user.  This is done with an *if statement*.  Try out this program:

-- table
Operator | Meaning
`==` | equal to
`!=` | not equal to
`>` | greater than
`>=` | greater than or equal to
`<` | less than
`<=` | less thanor equal to

Line 1 asks the user to input an answer.  At line 2, the `if` statement checks whether the answer entered is equal to "4".  If it is, the computer goes on to line 3, and then jumps down to the `end if` on line 6.  But if the answer is _not_ equal to "4", then it jumps from line 2 down to the `else` part on line 5.

You can do other kinds of comparisons, too.  See the table above for all the different *comparison operators* you can use to compare two values.

_Run the program several times, trying out different answers!_

An `if` statement can have many parts to deal with different conditions.  The first part, after the line with `if` and `then`, must always be there.  Then you can have any number of `else if` parts, checking for other conditions.  The first of these to match will run its code, skipping the rest.  Finally, an `else` part runs if _none_ of the conditions were true.  Which parts do you see in the program above?

A condition can be a simple comparison, or it can be several comparisons joined with `and` or  `or`.

Add two more `else if` parts to the program above: if the user enters "S", tell them to stop hissing; and if they enter "O", ask them if they are a ghost!

Here's a fun program that decides if the user is old enough to see a scary movie.  (If you don't like its decision, change the conditions â€” it's your program!)

Because we want to compare numbers, not messages, we convert the user's input into a number using val (as on page 15).
