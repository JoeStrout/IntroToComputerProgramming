<p>This book is written for two kinds of readers.  The first kind is someone who has never before done any computer programming.  Sure, you've heard the term, and you probably know that it's how games and apps are made — but you may not know what programming is actually <i>like</i>.  But by the end of this book, you will!  </p>
</div>
<div class="column-right">
<p>The other sort of reader is someone who has used other programming languages, but is curious about MiniScript or Mini Micro in particular.  Through this book you'll get a very fast and enjoyable introduction to what these tools can do, and be well on your way to creating your own Mini Micro games.</p>

<p>We begin with some instructions on installing Mini Micro, a free app you can use to run all the programs in this book.  Then, after a few pages of background information about computers and programming languages, you will be typing your very first computer commands, followed soon by short programs.  By the end of the book you will be entering (and understanding!) complete computer games.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you have Mini Micro running as you work your way through this book, and <b>try all the examples for yourself</b>.  Type them in and see what they do.  If you make a mistake, that’s OK!  You will learn far more this way than you would by merely reading about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="column-right">
<p>To further help your understanding, you will find “Programming Puzzles” in yellow boxes throughout the book.  These are little challenges to write a bit of code, or change one of the programs in a small way.  Answers to these puzzles are given in the back of the book.</p>
<p>You’re starting on a very exciting journey. Take your time, enjoy the trip, and above all, have fun!</p>
