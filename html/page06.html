<h2>Telling a Computer What to Do</h2>
</div>
<div class="section two-column">
<div class="column-left">
<p>Computers can carry out simple instructions, like adding numbers together, very fast — much faster than humans can.  But they don’t have any common sense.  For example, if someone asks you to give the cat a can of food, you probably know to open it first!  But a computer doesn’t think of things like that.  It has to be told what to do, step by step. </p>
<p>If you had a robot that could understand instructions, and you wanted it to feed and water your cat, you might write out instructions something like this:</p>
<p>1. Go to the cupboard.</p>
<p>2. Get out a can of cat food.</p>
<p>3. Go to the can opener.</p>
<p>4. Open the can with the can opener.</p>
<p>5. Put the can down for the cat.</p>
<p>6. Pick up the water bowl.</p>
<p>7. Go to the faucet.</p>
<p>8. Fill bowl with water from the faucet.</p>
<p>9. Put the bowl down for the cat.</p>

<p>Even this wouldn’t be detailed enough for a computer, though.  “Open the can with the can opener” would need a whole set of sub-steps explaining how to do that.  And while step 5 says to put the can down, it doesn’t specify which way to put it down.  The robot would probably just drop it, making a mess.</p>
<p>The thing about computers is, they’re fast, but they’re just not very smart.  You have to spell everything out for them, and if you have a mistake in your instructions, they will faithfully perform that mistake.</p>

<p>But that’s OK.  A computer is really just a sophisticated tool.  Like any tool, it takes some practice and experience to make it do what you want — but once you do, it can be used to create some really amazing things!</p>

<h4>Programming Languages</h4>
</div>
<div class="section two-column">
<div class="column-left">
<p>Natural human languages like English are too imprecise for computers.  So, we give instructions to computers using special programming languages.  These are designed to be unambiguous and precise.</p>
</div>
<div class="column-right">
<p>There are many, many different programming languages.  They may look different, but they all do the same thing: provide a way to give step-by-step instructions in a format that a computer can understand.</p>

<p>A sample of different programming languages is shown above.  Some use a lot of funny punctuation, while others use less.  Some are made of little pictures you drag around and connect together, but most are made for typing.  What other differences can you see?</p>
</div>
<div class="column-right">
<p>In this book you’ll be using a language called <b>MiniScript</b>.  It is a fairly new language, and designed to be especially simple and clear.  But once you’ve learned one programming language, it's easy to pick up others if you ever need them.</p>
